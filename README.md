# Programming 1 Portfolio
## Nastassja Motro 2017
### With Bryn Esperson and Tessa Vu

## Our Game
We have decided to create a Chess Game using the Java Language.
This program is just supposed to replicate the design of a chess game like one you would find on an app on your phone or on the computer. It's not as fancy with as many special effects as some other games but it still has many cool features.

### Starter
The game starts off with a main menu screen. We decided to create a theme based game. The them is Marvel v. DC.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nastassjamotro/Programming-1-Portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
